    <h1>My Personal Website</h1>
    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <img src="media/PWebIMGFixed.JPG">
    <h2>Magic: The Gathering</h2>
    <p>I am an avid player of the card game Magic: The Gathering. I have competed in several <abbr title="Grand Prix">GP</abbr>s and <abbr title="Pro Tour Qualifier">PTQ</abbr>s, and mostly play the Modern format. My deck of choice is Counters Company, a deck that uses the card Collected Company to assemble its win condition. For those that wish to learn how to play Magic, a good starting point is
        <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena">Magic: The Gathering Arena</a>, a free online client that will teach the basics of the game.</p>
    <h2>Destiny 2</h2>
    <p>I also enjoy playing the <abbr title="First Person Shooter">FPS</abbr> Destiny 2. I used to play exclusively on the Xbox One, but now that the game supports cross-save, I also play on PC. My main character is a Hunter, and I particularly enjoy using the Nightstalker subclass paired with the exotic armor piece Orpheus Rigs. I have been playing since the game launched and have completed every raid (including the recent Garden of Salvation raid) except for Crown of Sorrow and the Leviathan raid lairs. The base game for Destiny 2, known as New Light is currently free to play.</p>
